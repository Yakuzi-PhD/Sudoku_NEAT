This program uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a neural network in order to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Options:

Iterative Neural Network
Inputs: 9x9 cell values of starting grid (0 for empty cells)
Output: cell and value

Recurrent Neural Network
Inputs: 9x9 cell values of starting graid (0 for empty cells)
Output: 9x9 solutions, when new output is generated, it is checked and fed as input of the corresponding cell
